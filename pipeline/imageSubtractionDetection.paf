# Stage 1: link the input data into the DC2root tree
appStages: "lsst.dps.SymLinkStage.SymLinkStage" 

# Stage 2: load input data (science and template images) into memory
appStages: "lsst.dps.IOStage.InputStage"

# Stage 3: transform the per-visit metadata
appStages: "lsst.imageproc.pipeline.VisitMetadataStage"

# Stage 4: persist the per-visit metadata and the exposure

# Stage 5: subtract the images
appStages: "lsst.imageproc.pipeline.ImageSubtractStage" 

# Stage 6: write out the difference image
appStages: "lsst.dps.IOStage.OutputStage"

# Stage 7: detect sources in difference image
appStages: "lsst.detection.pipeline.DetectionStage" 

# Stage 8: write out the table of detected sources to the database
appStages: "lsst.dps.IOStage.OutputStage"

# Stage 9: send an event to the association pipeline indicating that
